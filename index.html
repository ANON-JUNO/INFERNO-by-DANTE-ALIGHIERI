                "Inferno" is the first part of Dante Alighieri's epic poem "The Divine Comedy," written in the early 14th century. It narrates Dante's journey through Hell, guided by the Roman poet Virgil, as he seeks to understand sin and its consequences.
                The poem is notable for its rich allegory, vivid imagery, and moral complexity, reflecting Dante’s views on sin, justice, and redemption.
